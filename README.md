# MineSweeper

Minesweeper has been a game that I used to play a lot as a child (5 year old). 
When I was young I never understood the game and the numbers it represented
and thought it was a game of pure luck that you just have to avoid the bombs
randomly placed around in the arena.

At work, I was asked to either move to a linux system. To make things easy I 
decided I am going to use Oracle Virtual Box and Ubuntu 22.04 because a GUI
just looked comfortable at taht time as I had never used linux based OS before
that. The installation came installed with gnome-mines.

One day I was too free at lunch and started playing the game again. Finally I
understood how the game works.

In an attempt to understand both how C++ projects work (beyond DSA / CP) and 
how the fuck do tiles explode I decided to make a terminal game of the same.

To try it out, download the .exe file it's safe (Just trust me bro).
